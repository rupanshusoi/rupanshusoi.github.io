## Hi, Reader!

I'm Rupanshu Soi, a CS junior at [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) in India!

I'm interested in programming languages, compilers and HPC.

## Three Summers

1. In summer 2021 I will be working with [Prof Sebastien Mosser](https://mosser.github.io/) at [UQAM](https://www.uqam.ca) in Montreal via [MITACS GRI](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship).

2. In summer 2020 I was lucky to work with an amazing group of people to write, [publish](https://conferences.computer.org/scwpub/pdfs/PAW-ATM2020-3hAMYwhCnnpHT0m34Bcu1H/545000a040/545000a040.pdf) and [present](https://sc20.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=ws_pawatm108&sess=sess218) my first paper in an [international workshop](https://sourceryinstitute.github.io/PAW/). I got interested in PL and compilers and made [my first PR](https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion/pull/800) to a major project! I also interned at [IGCAR](http://www.igcar.gov.in/), one of India's premier nuclear research labs, where I built a web-app using the MERN stack.

3. In summer 2019 I stayed back in university for a month to work with [Prof Anil Nemili's](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/nanil/Profile) scientific computing research group (I wrote my first paper with them one year later!). I also read Hofstadter's brilliant [GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach), which remains, to this day, the best book I've ever read.

## Open-Source Contributions
1. I've contributed to the Regent compiler on GitHub. Some of my contributions can be seen [here](https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion/pulls?q=author%3Arupanshusoi) and [here](https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion/issues?q=author%3Arupanshusoi+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug).

## Refereed Workshop Articles
1. _An Implicitly Parallel Meshfree Solver in Regent_. **Rupanshu Soi**, Nischay Ram Mamidi, Elliott Slaughter, Kumar Prasun, Anil Nemili, S.M. Deshapande. In Parallel Applications Workshop: Alternatives to MPI+X (PAW-ATM), November 2020. [[Abstract](https://sc20.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=ws_pawatm108&sess=sess218)][[Full Paper](https://conferences.computer.org/scwpub/pdfs/PAW-ATM2020-3hAMYwhCnnpHT0m34Bcu1H/545000a040/545000a040.pdf)]

## Links

I try to maintain an interesting and helpful collection of links.

1. As usual, [an amazing speech](https://www.mccurley.org/advice/hamming_advice.html) by Richard Hamming.

2. [Matt Might's blog](http://matt.might.net/articles) is one of the best sources of academic advice.

3. Some [great advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM) for academic writing from UChicago.

4. [Helpful resources](https://www.oacommunity.org/resources) for all kinds of academic writing.

5. David Poole's NSERC [grant application](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~poole/poole-NSERC-101-2010.pdf) (Don't get to see these too often!)

6. George Hotz's [outline](https://github.com/geohot/fromthetransistor) for a 12 week course for understanding the modern computer stack.
