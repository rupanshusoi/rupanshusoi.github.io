## Hi, Reader!

I'm Rupanshu Soi, a CS junior at [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) in India!

I'm interested in programming languages, compilers and HPC.

## Three Summers

1. In summer 2021 I will be working with Prof Sebastien Mosser at [UQAM](uqam.ca) in Montreal via [MITACS GRI](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship).

2. In summer 2020 I was lucky to work with an amazing group of people to write, [publish](https://conferences.computer.org/scwpub/pdfs/PAW-ATM2020-3hAMYwhCnnpHT0m34Bcu1H/545000a040/545000a040.pdf) and [present](https://sc20.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=ws_pawatm108&sess=sess218) my first paper in an [international workshop](https://sourceryinstitute.github.io/PAW/). I got interested in PL and compilers and made [my first PR](https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion/pull/800) to a major project! I also did a small internship at [IGCAR](http://www.igcar.gov.in/), one of India's premier nuclear research labs, where I built a web-app for monitoring a remotely deployed WSN using the MERN stack.

3. In summer 2019 I stayed back in university for a month to work with Prof Anil Nemili's group (I wrote my first paper with them one year later!). I also read Hofstadter's brilliant [GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach), which is, to this day, the best book I've ever read.

## Open-Source Contributions
1. I've contributed to the Regent compiler on GitHub. Some of my contributions can be seen [here](https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion/pulls?q=author%3Arupanshusoi) and [here](https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion/issues?q=author%3Arupanshusoi+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug).

## Refereed Workshop Articles
1. _An Implicitly Parallel Meshfree Solver in Regent_. **Rupanshu Soi**, Nischay Ram Mamidi, Elliott Slaughter, Kumar Prasun, Anil Nemili, S.M. Deshapande. In Parallel Applications Workshop: Alternatives to MPI+X (PAW-ATM), November 2020.
