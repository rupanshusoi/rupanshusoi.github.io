    <h3>Dynamic Analysis for Index Launches</h3>
        [<a href="https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion/pull/1054">Code</a>]<br>
         I developed a dynamic program analysis for determining the correctness of
         applying an optimization, known as an index launch, to a certain class of loops in
         the <a href="https://regent-lang.org">Regent</a> programming language.
         To confirm that the analysis had negligible run-time performance impact,
         I ran several experiments on Piz Daint, the #12 supercomputer in the world.

        Some of my contributions include bug fixes, support for some bitwise operators,
        and the <span class="contact">__future</span> keyword.

    <h3>Misty: A Scheme Interpreter in Lua</h3>
        [<a href="https://github.com/rupanshusoi/Misty">Code</a>]<br>
        This project is a personal exercise in understanding programming language implementation.
        Misty has basic notions of types and lexical scoping, but the implementation needs to be made much more concise.

    <h3>Selective Repeat Inspired File Transfer Protocol in Racket</h3>
        [<a href="https://github.com/rupanshusoi/Networks">Code</a>]<br>
        For my computer networks course, I had to design and implement a reliable file transfer protocol over UDP sockets.
        To challenge myself, I decided to use a language I had never used before: Racket. 
        My implementation is able to handle a variety of adverse network conditions: packet loss, delays, reordering, and corruption,
        and achieve speeds of upto 2.6 Gbps on local transfers.

    <h3>Runi: Handwritten Lexer and Parser in Go</h3>
        [<a href="https://github.com/rupanshusoi/Runi">Code</a>]<br>
        Runi is a context-free grammar, lexer, and recursive descent parser for a C-like language written in Go,
        with support for generating parse tree visualizations (depicting the leftmost derivation) using Graphviz.

    <h3>Brendr: Efficient Borrowing-Lending for Close-Knit Communities</h3>
      [<a href="https://github.com/mirameen/Brendr">Code</a>]
      [<a href="https://brendr.herokuapp.com">Prototype</a>]<br>
      Brendr is an online platform for borrowing-lending in college campuses (and similar closely knit communities)
      implemented using the MERN stack.
      It is a feature of Brendr to not support monetary transactions.
      A working prototype is hosted on Heroku.

    <h3>An Implicitly Parallel Meshfree Solver in Regent</h3>
      [<a href="https://github.com/rupanshusoi/meshfree_solver_regent">Code</a>]
      [<a href="https://sc20.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=ws_pawatm108&sess=sess218">Abstract</a>]
      [<a href="/pdfs/paw-atm-2020.pdf">Paper</a>]
      [<a href="https://github.com/sourceryinstitute/PAW/raw/gh-pages/PAW-ATM20/presentations/PAW-ATM2020_talk5.pdf">Slides</a>]<br>
      I developed a high-performance CFD solver based on q-LSKUM in Regent.
      Regent is an implicitly parallel programming language,
      which means users can write sequential code which is parallelized automatically.
      I compared my implementation against Fortran and Julia and published the results as an empirical study.
      I was fortunate to be part of <a href="https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/nanil/Profile">Dr. Anil Nemili's</a>
      scientific computing research group for this project.
